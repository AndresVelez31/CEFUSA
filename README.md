#  Web Application Project - CEFUSA

This is the repository for the development project of a **web application for the CEFUSA soccer school**. Here we will document and host all the code, database structure, functionalities, and processes that make up the club's new system.

- Digitize administrative and sports processes.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for coaches, administrators, and parents.
